# Project Sync directory

This directory is used for creating syncs to go upstream

The structure would be (where <INVENTORY_HOSTNAME> is a directory):
- <INVENTORY_HOSTNAME>/dump.sql
- <INVENTORY_HOSTNAME>/files

Note that dump.sql is not gzipped. Files directory is also not gzipped. They will
get synced and sent in a gzipped format automatically and is easier to work with
on the server.
